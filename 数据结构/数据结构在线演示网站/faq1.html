<big> <big> Frequently Asked Questions </big> </big>

<ul>
<li> <b> Can I use these visualizations for my class? </b>

<br>
Certainly!  Please send me an email if you do use these for your
  class (galles (at) usfca.edu), so that I know who is using it.  I'm more likely to keep up
  with updates if more people are using these visualizations.
</li> <br>
<li> <b>Does "Check for updates" actually work?  Will the program
    "call home" without my knowledge?</b>

<br>
Yes, "check for updates" does work!  If there is a newer version
available than the one you are using, you will be given a description of
the changes in the new version, and a button to download the newer
version. The program does <b>not</b>  "call home" unless you
specifically request an update check, and even then no information
about your machine is collected. </li> <br>
<li> <b>What tools did you use to create this? </b>

<br>
All of the GUI/graphical stuff uses swing, built on top of some great
  libraries developed by one of my
  students, <a href="javascript:;">Jean Bovet</a>,
  which were developed for
  a <a href="javascript:;">Visual Turing
  Simulator</a>.  Jean writes some fantastic stuff -- go check it out!
</li> <br>
<li> <b> Can I get the source code? </b>

<br>
The source code is now available on the download page!  Warning --  The
  code is not necessarily pretty, and the actual algorithms are pretty
  well obscured.  Use at your own risk!

</li> <br>
<li> <b> There's a bug in one of your visualizations! </b>

<br>
That's not really a question, is it?  Anyway, if you find a bug,
  check the known bugs / feature request page. If your bug is not on
  the list, send me an email -- galles (at) usfca.edu
</li> <br>
<li> <b> Could you please add a visualization for data structure XXX
    or algorithm YYY?</b>

<br>
  Check the known bugs / feature request page. If there is a data
  structure or algorithm you want that is not on this list, send me an
  email -- galles (at) usfca.edu.  All feature additions are made
  at my discretion, of course.  If you want to implement something
  yourself, get the source.  If you do add
  something cool, let me know so that I can incorporate your work into
  the general release.
